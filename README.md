# Pong Game in Python

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python. It features a two-player mode where players can control their paddles using keyboard inputs to hit the ball back and forth.

## How to use
- To play the game, run `main.py`.
- Player 1 uses the `W` and `S` keys to move their paddle up and down.
- Player 2 uses the `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow` keys to move their paddle up and down.
- The game starts immediately upon running the program.
- The score is kept at the top of the screen.
- No additional installation is required, as the Turtle library is included in the standard Python library.
